            <h1>All about the Force...</h1>
            There is no power quite like the Force.  The Force is what gives a Jedi his @Model.GetAdj1() power.  It's an energy field created by all @Model.GetAdj2() -noun-.  It binds the -noun- together.  The Force can be used for good or -adj-.  The Dark Side is -adj- and the -adj- Side is good. The Force -verb- a Jedi strong.  To use the Force requires willpower, discipline, and -adj-.  A person who is strong with the Force can move objects through the air with an outstretched -body part- or read the thoughts in another person's -body part-.  It takes a lot of energy to do this.  Some people are born with a -adj- connection to the Force.  It's a -adj- compliment to say "May the -object- be with you."
